# python-challenge -Kyle Kohlmeyer
This is my python challenge (challenge 3) submission. I did not use any code from outside sources. All the files are in the resources folder for both Pybank and Pypoll. Some of the commit messages are inaccurate, this was my first time doing a git push and I did not realise that the commit messages would appear before every file being pushed.
